# Module 1 - DevOps Introduction
## Summary
During this task I used Git to clone the remote private repository from GitHub to my workstation. I was adding and modifying files to commits, created few branches, performed merges. One of the merges resulted as a conflict, which I was able to solve by modifying the conflict file and committing the changes. Eventually I have collected the reference logs and pushed all local branch commits to the origin. 

As a result I enhanced my skills with Git.
### Commands used:
    git config --global user.name "user name"         # Sets the user name which is added to commits
    git config --global user.email "email address"    # Sets the email address which is added to commits
    git clone <url to Git repository>                 # Clones the remote repository to the workstation
    git add .                                         # Adds files to the Git staging area
    git commit -m "text"                              # Captures the snapshot of the currently staged changes with the comment
    git checkout <branch>                             # Switches over to another branch
    git checkout -b <branch>                          # Creates branch and switches over to it
    git status                                        # Displays the state of the staging area and working directory
    git merge <branch>                                # Merges the branches
    git log --help                                    # Displays the help file for git log command
    git reflog                                        # Shows the list of all operations performed in Git
    git push origin --all                             # Pushes all commits of all branches to origin
## My understanding of DevOps
DevOps is the set of practices designed to increase an organization's ability to deliver applications and services in the productive, fast and efficient pace. With this methodology, both development and operations teams work together across the entire software application life cycle, from development and test through deployment to operations.
