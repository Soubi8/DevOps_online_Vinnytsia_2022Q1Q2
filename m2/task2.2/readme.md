# Module 2 - Virtualization and Cloud Basic
## AWS Familiarization
1. I browsed through the __AWS User Guide__ and familiarized myself with the available information related to limitations of the used account
type as well as about the cost and billing.
2. The first thing that has to be done - registration on the AWS website. I created an AWS Free Tier account to try some services free of charge.
3. Continuously trying hands-on tutorials and labaratories. The latest progress can be seen via the following [link](http://m.obukhovskyi.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com "AWS Progress").
4. Next step was to find out information about EC2 instances. I logged into my AWS account, as a region I chose the Frankfurt eu-central-1. 
Then I went through the __Launch Instance__ process. I chose the _"Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 (HVM), SSD Volume Type - ami-06ec8443c2a35b0ba (64-bit x86)"_ 
as an Amazon Machine Image and _t2.micro_ Instance Type. I was offered to setup the instance details, add storage and tags, configure the 
security groups and review the instance creation.
where I read about each option and decided to go with the defaults for now. 
I saved the pair of private keys, which were used to connect to the instance afterwards.

5. Next task was to create a snapshot of the instance. I went to __Elastic Block Store__ -> __Snapshots__ -> __Create snapshot__ to achieve this.

6. To complete the next step, I went into __Volumes__, I created the volume named __Disk_D__ there and attached it
to my running instance. 
_Note:_ Important! The volume has to be created in the same availability zone, where the instance is, in order to be attached to it.

Then I connected through SSH to the instance and ran the following commands to attach the __Disk_D__, steps are shown on the below screenshot

To unmount the disk, I ran sudo `umount /dev/xvdb`

7. To complete the next task, first I created the image from the snapshot.

Then in __Images__ -> __AMIs__ I launched the instance from the previously created image.

8. As the next step I detached the volume __Disk_D__ from the first instance and attached it to the second.

I connected to the second instance and mounted the __Disk_D__. As you can see from the below screenshot, the file.txt created previously 
is present.

9. Reviewed the __Register a Domain Name with Amazon Route 53__ guide.
10. Followed the __Launch and configure a WordPress instance with Amazon Lightsail__ guide and launched my own WordPress instance with domain __itatsea.pp.ua__.

12. Familiarized myself with the __Batch upload files to the cloud to Amazon S3 using the AWS CLI__ guide and executed the same steps.

13. In this task I went through the steps in the __Docker basics for Amazon ECS__ tutorial.

## Summary
During this task I familiarized myself with the AWS "universe". It is very broad and I continue to explore it and gain knowledge about its offered services on the daily basis.
